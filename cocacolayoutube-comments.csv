Change Life,Coca-cola use to be my go to soda.  These days they have become racist towards white Americans.  I can't stand Coca-Cola.  Teaching employees how to be less white? What does Coca-Cola care if they are racist against white people as white people coubt in the whole world doesn't even come close to India and Asia combined.  Let alone Africa and South America.   Of course this liberal station just loves Coca-Cola now that Coca-Cola hates white people.,2022-02-04T00:37:12Z,0,0

Now it is the fight to be BIG vs. being GREAT. They still dominate global markets, but the variety isn’t the same.

432hz Love Frequency - TRUTH INSIDE OF YOU,"Mexico’s Coca-Cola Problem
February 10, 2016

What is one of the leading causes of death in Mexico? If you said the drug war, you would be right. That continuing calamity has taken more than 110,000 lives over the past decade. But a killer that has claimed far more lives, if not headlines, is Type 2 diabetes. That preventable illness kills 70,000 people each year in Mexico.

The public’s great thirst for Coca-Cola and other sugary beverages, based some say on culture, some on the lack of potable water, contributes to this national health crisis. Mexicans consume almost 500 cans of sugar-loaded soda per person every year. Mexico leads the world in fatalities—about 24,000 annually—linked to the overconsumption of sugar. Coca-Cola, which controls more than 73 percent of the country’s soft-drink market, is indeed killing Mexicans.

Fortunately, a 10 percent tax instituted in 2013 on sugar-enriched drinks is having the desired effect. In its first year, the tax reduced consumption of sugary drinks by 12 percent. That approach is something the United States, which has its own problems with the overconsumption of sugary drinks, might want to consider. An estimated 86 million Americans over age 20 are on their way to Type 2 diabetes. Also effective in encouraging healthier choices have been warning labels, required by some U.S. states, noting that consuming beverages with added sugars “contributes to diabetes, obesity and tooth decay.” The international purveyors of sugary beverages might pause to consider how their aggressive marketing thwarts public health initiatives in Mexico—indeed all over the world.",2021-12-27T21:21:55Z,0,0

That's one reason sales have died in the US. It literally makes me sick when I drink it over there. Another reason is the bastardisation of the brand. Instead of coming up with new names for new products, they just call it Coke-something. Every time there is another failed Coke product, of which there have been many, it dilutes the brand a little more. On top of that, their sales force has disappeared. We used to have the Coke reps coming into our pub once a week until the 90s, but are lucky to see them once every 3 months now and they never have any coasters or other merch. Try and find an independent fast food store that sells Coke these days. It's getting harder and harder, because the Pepsi reps have signed exclusive deals with most of them. They also need to go back to doing deliveries, instead of using supermarkets as their distributors.",2021-11-13T17:08:53Z,0,0

I know i'm not talking crap, because there is even a documentary about a town in Mexico which has the highest consumption of Coke, and also health problems. Look it up on youtube. Type in Mexico coca cola problem.

I'm 58 years old now, but I hate old soda that has a weird taste or it's flat with no fizz,  because they left it on the shelf too long. Why is this happening ? If Coca-Cola doesn't get on the ball and maintain its stock and supply of fresh beverages, they will lose in the end. Coca-Cola it's always been my preferred drink, but now I'm scared to buy it, because I wonder if it's going taste funny or be flat. How the mighty have fallen.....",2021-08-14T23:30:57Z,0,0

Amazon is investing so much money, that no competitor will ever be able to catch up.

Amazon's not going anywhere so I know that eventually it will come back.

Nige O' Blisco,"Coca cola carbonated drinks consumed each year, by my estimate, emit at least 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the earths atmosphere. Global warming anyone? Estimate based on Coca Colas own statement that .""More than 1.9 billion servings of our drinks are enjoyed in more than 200 countries each day."" My calculations assume a serving to be a standard can of coke 355ml and that each can contains approx 2.2g of carbon dioxide. So the maths are 1.9 billion cans x 2.2g x 365 days=1.525 Trillion grams per year. Convert that figure to metric tons, gives us 1.5257 Million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted into the Earths atmosphere.

In the old days of coke you use too grab a glass bottle from the machine, drink it, and then put it on a rack with a bunch of other empty bottles of Coca Cola.  These would then be taken back too a distribution center and decontaminated before being reused.  Sometimes older methods are more environmentally friendly then the modern ones are. Same with the milk man, leave the empty bottles on the doorstep, milk man comes by takes the old bottles back too be decontaminated, reused and leaves u fresh milk at the doorstep.

Corina greavu I quit yt,"Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.[1] The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. The drink has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas.

The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high-fructose corn syrup). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Cherry, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Coca-Cola was called Coca-Cola Classic from July 1985 to 2009, to distinguish it from ""New Coke"". Based on Interbrand's ""best global brand"" study of 2020, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most valuable brand.[2] In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.[3] Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[4]

John Pemberton, the original creator of Coca-Cola

Believed to be the first coupon ever, this ticket for a free glass of Coca-Cola was first distributed in 1888 to help promote the drink. By 1913, the company had redeemed 8.5 million tickets.[5]

This refurbished Coca-Cola advertisement from 1943 is still displayed in Minden, Louisiana.

Confederate Colonel John Pemberton, wounded in the American Civil War and addicted to morphine, also had a medical degree and began a quest to find a substitute for the problematic drug.[6] In 1885 at Pemberton's Eagle Drug and Chemical House, his drugstore in Columbus, Georgia, he registered Pemberton's French Wine Coca nerve tonic.[7][8][9][10] Pemberton's tonic may have been inspired by the formidable success of Vin Mariani, a French-Corsican coca wine,[11] but his recipe additionally included the African kola nut, the beverage's source of caffeine.[12]

It is also worth noting that a Spanish drink called ""Kola Coca"" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola. The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953.[13]

In 1886, when Atlanta and Fulton County passed prohibition legislation, Pemberton responded by developing Coca-Cola, a nonalcoholic version of Pemberton's French Wine Coca.[14] It was marketed as ""Coca-Cola: The temperance drink"", which appealed to many people as the temperance movement enjoyed wide support during this time.[1] The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886,[15] where it initially sold for five cents a glass.[16] Drugstore soda fountains were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health,[17] and Pemberton's new drink was marketed and sold as a patent medicine, Pemberton claiming it a cure for many diseases, including morphine addiction, indigestion, nerve disorders, headaches, and impotence. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the Atlanta Journal.[18]

By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market. A co-partnership had been formed on January 14, 1888, between Pemberton and four Atlanta businessmen: J.C. Mayfield, A.O. Murphey, C.O. Mullahy, and E.H. Bloodworth. Not codified by any signed document, a verbal statement given by Asa Candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in Pemberton's company as early as 1887.[19] John Pemberton declared that the name ""Coca-Cola"" belonged to his son, Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the formula.[20]

Charley Pemberton's record of control over the ""Coca-Cola"" name was the",2021-07-08T18:45:50Z,0,1
Corina greavu I quit yt,"underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the March 1888 Coca-Cola Company incorporation filing made in his father's place.[21] Charley's exclusive control over the ""Coca-Cola"" name became a continual thorn in Asa Candler's side. Candler's oldest son, Charles Howard Candler, authored a book in 1950 published by Emory University. In this definitive biography about his father, Candler specifically states: "" on April 14, 1888, the young druggist Asa Griggs Candler purchased a one-third interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as Coca-Cola.""[22] The deal was actually between John Pemberton's son Charley and Walker, Candler & Co. – with John Pemberton acting as cosigner for his son. For $50 down and $500 in 30 days, Walker, Candler & Co. obtained all of the one-third interest in the Coca-Cola Company that Charley held, all while Charley still held on to the name. After the April 14 deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.[23]

Company
In 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; ""The Coca-Cola Company"" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the ""Coca-Cola Company"" destroyed in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.[24]

After Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names ""Yum Yum"" and ""Koke"". This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name ""Coca-Cola"", all with his father's blessing. After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.[23]

John Pemberton died suddenly on August 16, 1888. Asa Candler then decided to move swiftly forward to attain full control of the entire Coca-Cola operation.

Charley Pemberton, an alcoholic and opium addict, unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else. Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name ""Coca-Cola"" from Pemberton's son Charley immediately after he learned of Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories states that Candler approached Charley's mother at John Pemberton's funeral and offered her $300 in cash for the title to the name. Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.[25]

In Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: ""On August 30 [1888], he Asa Candler became the sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy.""[26]

With this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.[27]

In 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged. Subsequent analysis of other similar transfer documents had also indicated John Pemberton's signature had most likely been forged as well, which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son Charley.[20]

On September 12, 1919, Coca-Cola Co. was purchased by a group of investors for $25 million and reincorporated in Delaware. The company publicly offered 500,000 shares of the company for $40 a share.[28][29]

In 1986, The Coca-Cola Company merged with two of their bottling operators (owned by JTL Corporation and BCI Holding Corporation) to form Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE).[30]

In December 1991, Coca-Cola Enterprises merged with the Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, Inc.[30]

Cody Pulley,Well we all know that you can take Coca-Cola and poured on battery acid and it will eat through the battery acid well the other day my friend told me that it works for unclogging a drain in your bathroom. Not to mention the high quantities of sugar will give you a fat stomach and a fat ass. Well who's to say what Coca-Cola does once it's mixed with stomach acids. Now I hear a rumor that they used to add cocaine to Coca-Cola. Probably not enough that you could tell you did some cocaine but the real reason that they quit adding cocaine to Coca-Cola wasn't because they outlawed it it was because the people that were making the Coca-Cola kept running out of product. LOL I mean they would order enough cocaine to make all the Coca-Cola's but somehow continuously fell short of product. I also hear that even though they quit adding the cocaine to the Coca-Cola they still keep it in inventory. Except for now they no longer order it out of Florida they get it out of Mexico. It used to be called boat Coke and now it's cold underground Coke. So I asked my friend do you get a pension working for Coca-Cola and he said yes but I traded mine for another line. All I know is I'm from Texas and the first time I ate at a Mexican restaurant and they said do you want a Mexican Coke and I said yes I'll take six of them and before I got out of the restaurant I ordered six more LMAO all joking aside I don't think the ingredients that are in Coca-Cola good bad or in different have hurt the Prophets. Well now that marijuana is legal almost everywhere why don't you put some good sativa in there. That way everybody be woke. New campaign slogan woke on coke,2021-06-26T11:12:59Z,0,0

Online News,"I'm thinking you misinterpreted some of what was said, they're not making less revenue than Pepsi, their revenue was affected more than Pepsi because a lot of Coca Cola's revenue comes from being served in restaurants like McDonald's, sport stadiums and arenas, so if those places were closed down or had a downturn in business it would likewise affect Coke.

Whereas Pepsi isn't in most of those businesses and they have other streams of revenue coming in from owning Pizza Hut and Frito Lay, but overall Coca Cola's operating margin is 30.78% and PepsiCo operating margin is 15.12% in 2021, so Coca Cola's profitability is still twice that of PepsiCo.

With all that being said, I am a bit biased considering I'm a shareholder of Coca Cola but those numbers are accurate, and Coca Cola's numbers should only get better for them.",2021-11-10T04:57:48Z,1,

Its a mixed oily cooktail that is mixed with water, and its used too cool the tool cuz of the trumendous heath that is created, while cutting metal

Now this stuff isnt made to be tasted, its quite hazardous if one are exposed to it enough, with constant working and no ventilation this stuff will eventually start to steam and by than enter potentially the mouth of a person close by.

I was exposed to this stuff while doing maintances right before lunch, went there was lunch i got a cola and tried it, tasted concerningly alike.

 Oil has to be extracted from deep below the sea or land, requiring exploration, heavy investment in manpower and technology.
It has to be transported over long distances to refineries, refined and stored until petrol has to be driven in tankers to you. Petrol is heavily taxed here, which makes the price of coca cola even more outlandish.
Basically, what is in coca cola? Carbonated tap water, sugar or artificial sweeteners, flavourings and colour?

jeffrey wolf,The stuff is toxic it's Thrift rust off of Rusty's items like nuts bolts pots pans Etc. Pour some on the ground and see what it does and then imagine what it's doing inside your stomach. At one time I was so hooked on that garbage I was drinking at least a six pack a day. So glad I got away from that have it. Because it didn't make me less thirsty it made me more thirsty,2021-05-18T13:21:12Z,2,2
jeffrey wolf,@travis clark sadly I know all about the acid in our stomachs. I have no large intestine due to colitis now I have Colitis and Crohn's. And what happens is your large intestine takes out 80% or more of the water you Body Kneads and also removes a lot of the stomach acid. Without that the stomach acid is a hundred times stronger and deteriorates the skin very quickly. You find out really quickly how much you need major organs once one is removed :(,2021-07-08T14:24:34Z,0,
travis clark,"It made you thirsty because your body had to process all that extra sugar in your system, which uses water to do so, less water than is in the actual can of soda. Acid is always in your stomach its not your stomach that takes the brunt on the damage it's your teeth(from the acid and from sugar causing bacteria to thrive on them, thus making them decay faster) and your pancreas (overload of sugar daily will make you overweight and put you at a huge risk for diabetes).",2021-07-08T08:42:16Z,1,

The rich see the global economic crisis as a garage sale, that's why investing right now and planning for your future will be the best decision you ever made.

There might be an economic turmoil but there's no doubt this is still the best time to invest, its time we take full control of our financial independence/freedom.

Daniel Mims,"I love coke but if I buy one at a convenience store , I'm getting the Mexican glass bottle Coke . It's $1.89 for .5 liter and made with cane sugar and taste so much better than any other coca-cola products. Compared to $2 for a plastic 20oz bottle I'd much rather have the imported Mexicoke . It's weird I used to live in Alaska and the Mexican cokes were the same price they were here in Texas, but the domestic ones were drastically more expensive: $2.59 for 20 oz plastic bottle. It was actually cheaper to buy a imported Mexicoke than the ones from the u.s. and I got hooked on them . Coke should license some of the older bottling companies around the country to make a cane sugar Coke like Dublin bottling company in Texas , who got famous for being the last Dr pepper bottler using pure cane sugar opposed to corn syrup. Dr pepper pulled the license like 15 years ago. Then Dr pepper released a pure cane sugar version afterwards and even used the same mint green color as Dublin Bottle caps had. It would be cool if coke licensed Dublin to make cane sugar variety of Coca-cola. That would be a hit for sure. People still talk about Dublin Dr Pepper. I grew up about 100 miles from there but there was a drug store that had them in a vending machine, so they were already like mythical status in the early 80s . Coke should make a Dublin coke it would certainly be a hit in the southwest . The fact that you can get a cane sugar Coke in a glass bottle that not only taste better , but that's around the same price , you would think they would notice.",2021-05-16T15:00:58Z,2,1

Like Caffeine, sugar is another one of the most addictive substances due to its effects on the brain, which trigger a release of dopamine, much like Cocaine does. Sugar is a feel-good substance that provides a lot of reward when consumed, leading to over consumption and eventually addiction.",2021-09-01T23:27:09Z,0,

f.e., glass uses more fuel in transport because of it's weight and it also consumes more water because the bottles need to be rinsed before they can be reused.
metal uses more energy, because the cans need to be melted and reformed. (they can't be rinsed like glass bottles)
plastic is very light, so is efficient in transport, but it has the shortest shelf life because the CO2 will slowly evaporate through the bottle. Currently plastic is not recycled as much as cans and glass, but it's increasing rapidly. (Coca Cola already uses 100% recycled bottles in Western Europe)",2021-05-16T09:50:44Z,2,

Pouring into a drinking glass is different, but in a bottle your nose isn't anymore over a can hole than a bottle hole. The hole size and position would be the same from a can to a bottle.  Bottled drinks are actually liable to taste weaker or more ""off"" than canned counterparts, scientifically, due to light degradation.

BUT if I'm at home I'll pour a can of Coke into a glass, and it's definitely better.

The other part of this is that when you drink from a glass, your nose is over the beverage. And since a large part of taste actually comes from smell, you get a fuller taste.

H H,@Amari Jackson nope. They'll just accrue interest and take you to court for it then you can pay it over time. Quarterly payments and estimated payments.

Avo SC,"Hey, the liver doesn't process the coke directly.

What happens is that the nutrients of whatever you eat gets broken down and absorbed by the stomach and intestines. Those nutrients then goes into the liver from the bloodstream. Any colors will stay in the stomach and be excreted into the bile. 
The liver does not process the coke or its colors, but instead the nutrients. The stuff in coke doesn't harm the liver at all. However, what we should worry about is the pancreas!  
Overtime, the high sugar amount from the coke (aka carbs) will harm the pancreas. The pancreas produces insulin that assists in the absorbtion of sugar (the liver doesn't absorb sugar). With too much of sugar,  the pancreas will reach its limit and wont be able to produce enough insulin to process the sugar. When it can't process the sugar, the sugar enters the bloodstream directly and leads to diabetes (high blood sugar).

 But one or two sips of coke shouldn't be a problem. The pancreas is always producing insulin because sugar ( carbs) is in everything. 

So, the pancreas is what we should worry about, not the liver.",2021-05-15T17:01:48Z,4,
